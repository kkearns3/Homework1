    "text": "What do you think being a data scientist is about?\n\nPrior to this class, my impression was that data scientists need to use mathematical and/or logical principles to make sense of large amounts of data from both conventional and unconventional sources. They require skills in programming (SQL/Python/R/maybe SAS) and visualization (Tableau/Power BI) with enough of a mathematical background to logically and efficiently piece together disparate tables and analyze them soundly. I also thought that statistics was an important piece of this; a data scientist needs to understand enough methodology to recognize good and sufficient data and how to draw sound conclusions from them. After the readings for this week, I would add that the current atmosphere seems to have a lot of buzz around machine learning and artificial intelligence, but I don’t know how long-term that is.\n\nWhat differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\n\nStatisticians have more classical training, and probably have more mathematics/calculus background than a data scientist.\nStatisticians may have more focus on setting up experiments/data collection with a large enough sample size so they can ensure their results are valid and as close of an approximation to the actual value as they feel is necessary. This front-end planning is really important for making sure the conclusions they get are sound, and they have tools and methods that communicate how “good” their results are and are clear about what their results don’t say.\nI get the impression that data scientists often have data dumped in their laps (or maybe they write data-mining scripts) and then they need to fit the right model.

Data science is really broad, and very useful for probably most (all?) industries…but I feel that data science-focused graduate programs are too new and variable right now. I feel that gaining skills from the classical, well-established discipline of statistics will be more applicable and less vulnerable to obsolescence than a data science program.
