## Data Science Questions

(@) *What do you think being a data scientist is about?*
    + I thought I knew.
(@) *What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?*
    + I haven't met many actual data scientists, but the few I have met all have very different backgrounds and skillsets, and all had at least one glaring blindspot.
(@) *How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?*
    + I am somewhere in between and am faking it until I make it.

## Running Code

Density function for Petal Width from the Iris data set

```{r}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)
```

Further information about this R object
```{r}
class(y)
typeof(y)
structure(y)
```

Here's a plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
plot(y)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
